## Continuous-Integration Guidelines

**Key Points:**

- Should be implemented at the beginning of a project and then expand to continuous delivery and continous deployment.
- Important to make pull requests daily and merges to master daily otherwise expose to having too many conflicts and easier to debug.
- **Helpful Tools:** Tests, Typescript Linting, Circle CI, Travis CI, Jenkins (similar to CircleCI but with flexibility to manage server), Bamboo, Codeship, Prettier(formats code to look same)
